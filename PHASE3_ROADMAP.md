# Phase 3: CNN-Based Object Detection Integration

## Overview
Phase 3 enhances the object follower with deep learning capabilities using CNNs for more robust object detection and classification.

## Architecture

### 1. Multi-Method Detection System
- **Color Detection** (Phase 2) - Fast, lightweight
- **CNN Detection** (Phase 3) - Robust, accurate
- **Hybrid Mode** - Combines both methods

### 2. CNN Models to Implement
- **YOLOv5 Nano** - Real-time object detection
- **MobileNet** - Lightweight classification
- **Custom Person Detector** - Follow specific person

### 3. Enhanced Features
- **Multi-object tracking** - Follow multiple targets
- **Object classification** - Distinguish between objects
- **Person following** - Specific human tracking
- **Confidence-based switching** - Best detection method selection
